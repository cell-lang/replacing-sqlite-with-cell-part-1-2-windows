# Replacing SQLite with Cell, parts 1-2

This is the companion repository for the first two posts in the *Replacing SQLite with Cell* series:

* <a href='https://medium.com/@cell.lang.dev/replacing-sqlite-with-cell-part-1-fb5d636b5fd0'>Replacing SQLite with Cell, part 1: Meet the programmable database</a>
* <a href='https://medium.com/@cell.lang.dev/replacing-sqlite-with-cell-part-2-a5eb6a21de2d'>Replacing SQLite with Cell, part 2: Complex queries and custom types</a>

This is the Windows-only version. You can find the cross-platform one <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/replacing-sqlite-with-cell-part-1-2-unix'>here</a>.

You'll need to have a recent version of Visual Studio or the .NET framework. Make sure the command line C# compiler (csc.exe) is on your path. Then cd into the repository's directory, type *build* and follow the on-screen instructions.

There are two versions of this project. The one that is built by default is written entirely in Cell. The other one is a mixed language application, where the classes generated by the Cell compiler are used in hand-written C# code. Their output is almost identical. To build the embedded version type *build-embedded*.

The recommended editor for browsing and editing Cell code is Sublime Text 3. You can find the syntax highlighting files in ```compiler/sublime-text/```. Just copy them in ```C:\Users\*YourUsernameHere*\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User```.
